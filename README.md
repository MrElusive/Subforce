# Subforce
Perforce plugin for Sublime Text 3 that leverages the P4Python API.

!!! This plugin is still under heavy development. No efforts have been made yet to distribute it through Package Control. You have been warned. !!!

To install, sync this repository to Packages/Subforce. You will also need to install the [SublimeP4Python](https://github.com/MrElusive/SublimeP4Python) dependency.

Note: In order for the P4Python API to work, you are required to you specify a [.p4config](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/r15.2/manuals/cmdref/P4CONFIG.html) file in the root of your workspace and set your the P4CONFIG environment variable to that file name.
